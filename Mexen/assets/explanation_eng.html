<h4>General</h4>
<p>
Mex is a drinking game, played with two or more dice and two or more participants. Mex is the combination of two dice with both one and two pips, or <b>21</b>. In addition there are the throws <i>indicate</i> and <i>low</i>, respectively <b>31</b> and <b>32</b>. The former forces the thrower to indicate another participant to drink is drink ad fundum, the latter is the lowest possible combination. When naming a combination, the highest number of pips is taken first, such that 31 becomes <i>thirty-one</i>. The exceptions are combinations of dice that have the same number of pips, such as 11, which becomes <i>one hundred</i>, and 111, <i>one thousand</i>. Another concept that is important in the game is <i>withholding</i> dice. In certain situations, which will be explained later on, it is allowed to withhold a die for throwing.
</p>
<p>
The intent of the game is that the participant, with the lowest score during a round, looses. This participant will start the next game. Each turn consists of three throws, where the final throw is relevant in the remainder of the round.
</p>
<p>
In this application it is possible to use either two or three dice. Several variants of the game exist, but in this app the variant played at the  Delftsch Studenten Corps is considered.
</p>
<h4>2 dice</h4>
<p>
<i>Mex</i> is the highest possible throw. Together with <i>low</i>, these two are the only throws that end the turn, regardless of the number of throws. More than three throws is possible as well, because the <i>indicate</i> throw is not counted as a throw.
</p>
<p>
If, when the round is finished, multiple participants have the same lowest throw, they will have to start a new round among themselves. The participant that is first to observe and claim the situation of the muliple lowest throws, is designated to start this new round.
</p>
<p>
Normally, each turn consists of three throws, except when a special throw occurs. But there is an additional exception, which considers the turn of the initiating participant. If that participant ends the turn in only 1 or 2 throws, which can happen with a <i>mex</i> or <i>low</i>, the remainder of the participants is allowed only the same amount of throws.
</p>
<p>
<i>Withholding</i>, means that only one die can be withheld from throwing, and only a die with 1,2 or 3 pips is allowed. The same die can not be withheld twice. Withholding a die can even transcend turns, which means that the previous final throw of a participant can affect the first throw of the next. The special throws, <i>mex</i>, <i>low</i> and <i>indicate</i> are excepted from this rule, meaning that those dice can not be withheld.
</p>
<h4>3 dice</h4>
<p>
Playing with 3 dice is especially interesting in the form of <i>blind mex</i>, which is the variant introduced here. Blind mex, or <i>bluff mex</i>, is named after the fact that other participants cannot see what is thrown (usually with a cup). Because the throw is unseen, the participant can bluff about the throw.
</p>
<p>
With three dice the principle of counting the combinations is similar to two dice, i.e. the combination 433 is called four hundred and thirty-three. There is not official <i>low</i> throw anymore, nor a <i>indicate</i>, but there are 6 <i>mex</i> throws. Namely, the combination 216 is called <i>mex-six</i>, also the highest achievable score. Withholding dice is now allowed for any number of pips, naturally with a maximum of two dice at the time.
</p>
<p>
Every participant is allowed one throw, after which the participant has to call the throw to the next participant. That participant has two options: believe the previous participant and call a higher throw to the next participant, or don't believe the previous partcipant and look at the throw.
</p>
<p>
In the former case the participant has three options for surrendering the dice to the next participant and naming a higher combination than the previous. First, the participant can surrender the dice untouched. Second, the participant can re-throw and surrender the dice. Finally, the participant can look at the dice, pick up up to two of the dice, and throw the remaining dice. Those withheld dice are there for everyone to see, and the next participant can consider withholding them as well or throwing them anyway.
</p>
<p>
In the latter case the throw could either be higher or equal to what the previous participant claimed, or it could be lower. In the former case the participant looses and starts a new round. In the latter case the previous participant looses and starts a new round.
